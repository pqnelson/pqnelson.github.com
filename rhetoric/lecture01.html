<b>1.</b> What is rhetoric?
</p>
<p>
It comes from the Greek word <em>Rhetorica</em> meaning "Public
speaking". It first and foremost means public speaking, but it
typically is focused on persuasion. 
</p>
<p>
It could be considered the art of persuasion. This includes
written expression.  
</p>
<p>
Until the renaissance, it was focused more on "oral
speaking"-based persuasion.
</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> The alphabet derived from the Phoenicians (hence
"phonetical"). The biggest contribution from the Greeks was the
invention of the vowel.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Early Roman hero is the silent type that gets stuff done (think
John Wayne). The Greek hero is also eloquent, a good speaker, who
gets stuff done. As Homer describes it, a "speaker of words and
doer of deeds."
</p>
<p>
Rhetoric becomes useful in Greek politics and judicial affairs.
</p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles">Pericles <tt>[wikipedia.org]</tt></a>
(500-429 BC) rules Athens
because he is an excellent public speaker.
</p>
<p>
<b>5. Historical Origins.</b> In
466BC, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasybulus">Thrasybulus
<tt>[wikipedia.org]</tt></a> (Tyrant of Syracuse) overthrown. 
</p>
<p>
Corax makes money teaching rhetoric: rhetoric developed
hand-in-hand with Law. Corax taught Tisias, but Tisias didn't pay
his tuition. 
Corax sued Tisias for the money. 
</p>
<p>
Tisias argues he shouldn't pay: if he's found guilty, then
"obviously" he never learned rhetoric (otherwise he would have
been able to defend himself in court). If he's found innocent,
then being innocent he shouldn't pay!
</p>
<p>
Corax reversed this argument, positing that if Tisias is found
guilty, then Tisias should pay. And if Tisias is found innocent,
then "obviously" Tisias learned rhetoric and should pay for
instruction.
</p>
<p>
This is one of the first cases in history thrown out of court,
with the judge commenting "a bad crow lays a bad egg." This
entire case is more legend than fact.
</p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> The first people who studied rhetoric, the earliest
"texts" were enumerating tricks to win court cases.
</p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> There is some antagonism in this field between
"persuasion" and "constructing a logically sound argument". 
</p>
<p>
The Greek system had two outcomes: innocent or guilty. 
</p>
<p>
In the Athenian Court System, you had to defend yourself. You
cannot hire a lawyer!
</p>
<p>
Instead you hired someone to write a speech for you to
speek. Logographer = person who writes the speech.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysias">Lysias <tt>[wikipedia.org]</tt></a>
was a famous Logographer.
</p>
<p>
<b>8.</b> The most general approach focuses on notions of
probability. Rhetoric focuses on probability, i.e., what is
likely based off of our everday experience.
</p>
<p>
<b>9.</b> Another approach questions a person's character,
appeals to emotions. Some of the earlier books focuses on
invoking emotions.
</p>
<p>
Notions of commonality is also a good element, e.g., "He's just 'one of
the guys', he can't be guilty of that!"
</p>
<p>
<b>10.</b> The Athenian approach to infrastructure was the rich
people pay for things, using "private funding under public control" (an approach
called <a href="http://articles.mcall.com/2012-02-28/opinion/mc-history-of-taxes-cook-yv-0229-20120228_1_special-tax-liturgies-polis">"liturgies" <tt>[mcall.com]</tt></a>).
</p>
<p>
For a certain period, too, military generals were elected. Greeks
quickly found that great speakers win elections, and seldom make
good generals.
</p>
<p>
<b>11.</b> Sophists typically arrived into a town, gives a speec,
and recruitys a handful of
students. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgias">Gorgia <tt>[wikipedia.org]</tt></a> was a
sophist, and part of a Syracusan embassy to Athens attempting to
convince Athenians to intercede in Syracuse's politics.
</p>
<p>
Gorgias epitomized sophistry, and spoke well. Plato uses Gorgias
as an example of what's wrong with rhetoric.
</p>
<p>
Aristophanes' <em>The Clouds</em> ridicules Socrates for many of
the same things Plato ridicules Gorgias for.
</p>
<p>
Although rhetoric is good as a virtue, it permits evil people to
go free and innocent men to be jailed.
</p>
<p>
Gorgias' <a href="./onHelen.html">Encomium on Helen</a> should be
read next.
