(1) What is becoming to a city is manpower, to a body beauty, to
a soul wisdom, to an action virtue, to a speech truth, and the
opposites of these are unbecoming. Man and woman and speech and
deed and city and object should be honored with praise if
praiseworthy and incur blame if unworthy, for it is an equal
error and mistake to blame the praisable and to praise the
blamable. (2) It is the duty of one and the same man both to
speak the needful rightly and the refute the unrightfully
spoken. Thus it is right to refute those who rebuke Helen, a
woman about whom the testimony of inspired poets has become
univocal and unanimous as has the ill omen of her name, which has
become a reminder of misfortunes. For my part, by introducing
some reasoning into my speech, I wish to free the accused of
blame and, having reproved her detractors as prevaricators and
proved the truth, to free her from their ignorance.

<p>
(3) Now it is not unclear, not even to a few, that in nature and
in blood the woman who is the subject of this speech is
preeminent among preeminent men and women. For it is clear that
her mother was Leda, and her father was in fact a god, Zeus, but
allegedly a mortal, Tyndareus, of whom the former was shown to be
her father because he was and the latter was disproved because he
was said to be, and the one was the most powerful of men and the
other the Lord of all. (4) Born from such stock, she had godlike
beauty, which taking and not mistaking, she kept. In many did she
work much desire for her love, and her one body was the cause of
bringing together many bodies of men thinking great thoughts for
great goals, of whom some had greatness of wealth, some the glory
of ancient nobility, some the vigor of personal agility, some
command of acquired knowledge. And all came because of a passion
which loved to conquer and a love of honor which was
unconquered. (5) Who it was and why and how he sailed away,
taking Helen as his love, I shall not say. To tell the knowing
what they know shows it is right but brings no delight.
</p>
<p>
Having gone beyond the time once set for my speech, I shall go on
to the beginning of my future speech, and I shall set forth the
causes through which it is likely that Helen's voyage to Troy
should take place. (6) For either by will of Fate and decision of
the gods and vote of Necessity did she do what she did, or by
force reduced or by words seduced or by love possessed.
</p>
<p>
Now if through the first, it is right for the responsible one to
be held responsible; for god's predetermination cannot be
hindered by human premeditation. For it is the nature of things,
not for the strong to be hindered by the weak, but for the weaker
to be ruled and drawn by the stronger, and for the stronger to
lead and the weaker to follow. God is a stronger force than man
in might and in wit and in other ways. If then one must place
blame on Fate and on a god, one must free Helen from disgrace.

(7) But if she was raped by violence and illegally assaulted and
unjustly insulted, it is clear that the raper, as the insulter,
did the wronging, and the raped, as the insulted, did the
suffering. It is right then for the barbarian who undertook a
barbaric undertaking in word and law and deed to meet with blame
in word, exclusion in law, and punishment in deed. And surely it
is proper for a woman raped and robbed of her country and
deprived of her loved ones to be pitied rather than pilloried. He
did the dread deeds; she suffered them. It is just therefore to
pity her but to hate him. 
</p>
<p>
(8) But if it was speech which persuaded her and deceived her
heart, not even to this is it difficult to make an answer and to
banish blame as follows. Speech is a powerful lord, which by
means of the finest and most invisible body effects the divinest
works: it can stop fear and banish grief and create joy and
nurture pity. I shall show how this is the case, since (9) it is
necessary to offer proof to the opinion of my hearers: I both
deem and define all poetry as speech with meter. Fearful
shuddering and tearful pity and grievous longing come upon its
hearers, and at the actions and physical sufferings of others in
good fortunes and in evil fortunes, through the agency of words,
the soul is wont to experience a suffering of its own. But come,
I shall turn from one argument to another. (10) Sacred
incantations sung with words are bearers of pleasure and
banishers of pain, for, merging with opinion in the soul, the
power of the incantation is wont to beguile it and persuade it
and alter it by witchcraft. There have been discovered two arts
of witchcraft and magic: one consists of errors of soul and the
other of deceptions of opinion. (11) All who have and do persuade
people of things do so by molding a false argument. For if all
men on all subjects had both memory of things past and awareness
of things present and foreknowledge of the future, speech would
not be similarly similar, since as things are now it is not easy
for them to recall the past nor to consider the present nor to
predict the future. So that on most subjects most men take
opinion as counselor to their soul, but since opinion is slippery
and insecure it casts those employing it into slippery and
insecure successes. (12) What cause then prevents the conclusion
that Helen similarly, against her will, might have come under the
influence of speech, just as if ravished by the force of the
mighty? For it was possible to see how the force of persuasion
prevails; persuasion has the form of necessity, but it does not
have the same power. For speech constrained the soul, persuading
it which it persuaded, both to believe the things said and to
approve the things done. The persuader, like a constrainer, does
the wrong and the persuaded, like the constrained, in speech is
wrongly charged. (13) To understand that persuasion, when added
to speech, is wont also to impress the soul as it wishes, one
must study: first, the words of Astronomers who, substituting
opinion for opinion, taking away one but creating another, make
what is incredible and unclear seem true to the eyes of opinion;
then, second, logically necessary debates in which a single
speech, written with art but not spoken with truth, bends a great
crowd and persuades; and, third, the verbal disputes of
philosophers in which the swiftness of thought is also shown
making the belief in an opinion subject to easy change. (14) The
effect of speech upon the condition of the soul is comparable to
the power of drugs over the nature of bodies. For just as
different drugs dispel different secretions form the body, and
some bring an end to disease and others to life, so also in the
case of speeches, some distress, others delight, some cause fear,
others make the hearers bold, and some drug and bewitch the soul
with a kind of evil persuasion.

(15) It has been explained that if she was persuaded by speech
she did not do wrong but was unfortunate. I shall discuss the
fourth cause in a fourth passage. For if it was love which did
all these things, there will be no difficulty in escaping the
charge of the sin which is alleged to have taken place. For the
things we see do not have the nature which we wish them to have,
but the nature which each actually has. Through sight the soul
receives an impression even in its inner features. (16) When
belligerents in war buckle on their warlike accouterments of
bronze and steel, some designed for defense, others for offense,
if the sight sees this, immediately it is alarmed and it alarms
the soul, so that often men flee, panic stricken from future
danger as though it were present. For strong as is the habit of
obedience to the law, it is ejected by fear resulting from sight,
which coming to a man causes him to be indifferent both to what
is judged honorable because of the law and to the advantage to be
derived from victory. (17) It has happened that people, after
having seen frightening sights, have also lost presence of mind
for the present moment; in this way fear extinguishes and
excludes thought. And many have fallen victim to useless labor
and dread diseases and hardly curable madnesses. In this way the
sight engraves upon the mind images of things which have been
seen. And many frightening impressions linger, and what lingers
is exactly analogous to what is spoken. (18) Moreover, whenever
pictures perfectly create a single figure and form from many
colors and figures, they delight the sight, while the creation of
statues and the production of works of art furnish a pleasant
sight to the eyes. Thus it is natural for the sight to grieve for
some things and to long for others, and much love and desire for
many objects and figures is engraved in many men. (19) If,
therefore, the eye of Helen, pleased by the figure of Alexander,
presented to her soul eager desire and contest of love, what
wonder? If, being a god, Love has the divine power of the gods,
how could a lesser being reject and refuse it? But if it is a
disease of human origin and a fault of the soul, it should not be
blamed as a sin, but regarded as an affliction. For she came, as
she did come, caught in the net of Fate, not by the plans of the
mind, and by the constraints of love, not by the devices of art. 
</p>
<p>
How then can one blame of Helen as unjust, since she is utterly
acquitted of all charge, whether she did what she did through
falling in love or persuaded by speech or ravished by force or
constrained by divine constraint? 
</p>
<p>
I have by means of speech removed disgrace from a woman; I have
observed the procedure which I set up at the beginning of the
speech; I have tried to end the injustice of blame and the
ignorance of opinion; I wished to write a speech which would be a
praise of Helen and a diversion to myself.
