<b>1.</b> 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isocrates">Isocrates <tt>[wikipedia.org]</tt></a> suffered
Agoraphobia. He never really delivered a speech. (Isocrates had a
weak voice.) His first noteworthy job was as a logographer. 
</p>
<p>
Eventually (c.390 BC) he began teaching rhetoric.
</p>
<p>
In many ways, Plato and Isocrates have the same aims: give moral
character to rhetoric. Isocrates taught solely in Athens
(compared to the Sophists who traveled). 
</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> Isocrates innovated education. He first demanded an
entrance requirement, and he was the first to require tuition up
front (avoiding repeats of Corax and Tisias).
</p>
<p>
His teaching was  secular, his schools were small. A class lasted
for 3 years. He never had more than 5 or 6 students at a time.
</p>
<p>
Isocrates taught by imitation. There is no other way to learn, at
least in Antiquity.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Isocrates viewed himself an opponent of the Sophist's
rhetoric (the idea you could convince anyone of anything).
</p>
<p>
Instead Isocrates argued you have to be a good person to be pursuasive.
</p>
<p>
The goal of education was to make people better individuals. But
there is no notion of public education.
</p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> Discourse is always about political issues. The theme,
for Isocrates, was always "unity of the Greeks."
</p>
<p>
Isocrates frequently discusses Pan-Hellenic unity, the idea of a Greek nation.
</p>
<p>
Culture, he argues, is the supreme good. "The people we call
Greeks are thosee who have the same culture as ours---not the 
same blood," he once wrote.
</p>
<p>
This develops into classical Humanism (which argues humans are
united more by culture than race). Words are what distinguish
humans from animals. 
</p>
<p>
There is no distinction between form and content: if an orator
wants to produce a work of art, s/he must <b>not</b> be using a
trivial subject.
