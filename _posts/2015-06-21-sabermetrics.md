**Abstract:** As a playground for statistical thinking, we examine
baseball data. Very crude and basic statistical heuristics are
introduced, the mean & standard deviation discussed, and the linear
regression heuristically motivated. We make some embarrassingly wrong
predictions.

We assume some familiarity with probability. Those who want to learn
more about probability are free to read my [notes]({{ site.url }}/assets/probability.pdf).

# Introduction

I needed to learn statistics, so I thought I would try to learn it
through applying the tools to baseball ("sabermetrics" is the technical
term for *quantitative baseball*). If you do not know the rules of the
game, there's a [8 minute YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/0bKkGeROiPA)
summarizing it.

Generally, "baseball season" starts towards the end of March, and ends
at the beginning of October.

The game seems pretty simple, so how hard can it be to quantitatively
describe it? There are:

- 41 batting statistics
- 7 base run statistics
- 50 pitching statistics
- 12 fielding statistics
- 3 "overall player value" statistics, and
- 4 statistics associated to each game

...for a grand total of 117 statistics to juggle around. How can we tell
which ones are valuable and which ones are junk?

Already, this appears quite daunting: what do we even want to do with
our 117 statistics?

**Step 0:** Formulate a problem we wish to solve with our given
data. (End of Step 0)

# Problem Statement

Find a function which, given two baseball teams who will play each
other, will produce the winner of the game.

**Extra Credit.** Predict the end score for the game.

**Basic Solution.** The basic idea would be to predict the "runs scored"
variable (*R*) for each team. Whichever one is higher naturally
indicates the winner. (In the *argot* of statistics, the number of runs
for a given game will be the *response variable* â€” i.e., we want to
"model", i.e. construct a function, *R(...)* which will approximate the
number of runs by the end of the game.)

# Getting Setup

I did most of the difficult work already, and one just has to follow the
instructions in the [documentation](https://github.com/pqnelson/gambletron/tree/master/doc) for the [project](https://github.com/pqnelson/gambletron).
Checkout `v0.1.0` for the relevant code.

## First Steps

"Great, we have a huge database full of data, what do I do?" Well, in
general, we usually want to examine the variables and identify them as
either categorical, continuous, or ordinal (think of this as an ordered
statistic with finite values, like on surveys where you can judge some
service as "Best", "Good", "Neutral", "Bad", "Horrible").

**Step 1:** Examine the data, specifically the data related to the
question we posed in step 0. (End of Step 1)

This includes examining the average value for the relevant signals. We
will soon find out, as Nate Silver
[pointed out](http://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/5133141/Nate-Silver-What-I-need-from-statisticians.html),
"The average is still the most useful statistical tool ever invented."

For us, lets consider examining a few values. We're interested in the
runs in a game, and homeruns are related to the number of runs so lets
look at those too. Lets see the raw data for the past 10 years:

```clojure
sabermetrics.team> (def t1 (since 2005))
sabermetrics.team> (reduce + (map :games-played t1))
43736
sabermetrics.team> (reduce + (map :hits t1))
388118
sabermetrics.team> (reduce + (map :runs t1))
195074
sabermetrics.team> (reduce + (map :homeruns t1))
43209
```

**Remark on Double Counting.** Note that a baseball game involves *two
teams*, so if we just add up all the games each team has been in...we'll
double count the number of games. Just bear this in mind when performing
the statistical analysis. (End of Remark)

So, it's interesting:

- the ratio of runs to hits is approximately roughly 50.26%,
- an average of 8.92 runs per game,
- 17.75 hits per game on average,
- the ratio of home runs to runs is approximately 20.15%,
or 1/5,
- whereas there is roughly 2 home run per game on average (well,
1.9759 home runs per game, but still!).

What do these statistics look like for the past 5 years or so?

Home runs per game fluctuating "a bit", runs per game "roughly steady",
and the ratio of home runs to runs "steady-ish".

**Observations.** (1) We should probably formalize a notion of "fluctuating a
bit", versus "steady-ish". In this manner, we can *rigorously* say "This
signal is more *x-times* more steady than that one." (2) Analyzing these
ratios year-by-year is tiresome and error-prone (saying "Yep, that looks
good enough" is error-prone). We need some way to get the data with a
cursory glance. (End of Observations)

### Variance

We can determine the magnitude of fluctuation by using
**"Variance"**. There is actually quite a bit of subtlety to this
notion, but it is surprisingly simple: it measures "how far off" the
mean is from the sample values. Consider the sample
`[5, 3, 1, 3, 5]`. We see its average is 17/5=3.4. We can plot these
data points, the mean as a horizontal line, and red arrows from the data
points to the mean:

![Standard deviation visualized]({{ site.url }}/assets/standard-dev.png)

The average for the sum of the squares of the lengths of the red line
segments *is* the variance, its square-root is the standard
deviation. The labels on the *x*-axis just indicates which element of
our list we're examining. *The average square-distance to the mean*, is
our intuitive picture of the variance. (Hey, the average is used to
figure out how much a data set varies, pretty nifty.)

**Definition.** Given a collection of values
<span>$\\{x\_{1},\dots, x\_{N}\\}$</span>,
its **"Mean"** (or *average*) is
<span>$\bar{x} = \sum\_{j} x\_{j}/N$</span>. Its **"Variance"** is
<div>
$$\sigma^{2}=\frac{1}{N}\sum\_{j}(x\_{j}-\bar{x})^{2}.$$
</div>

**Puzzle.** Given the set `[1,2,3]`, what is its mean? What is its
variance?

If we consider the set `[1,2,3,x]`, what value of `x` makes its standard
deviation be the same as that for `[1,2,3]`? (End of Puzzle)

(In the picture doodled for our situation, the variance is precisely
1.696 and the standard deviation is approximately 1.3023.)

**Remark.** One last remark about standard deviation. If we are
considering some subset of a population, e.g., the height of 20
lions...then we do not divide by *N*, we need to divide by *N*-1. This
is [Bessel's Correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction),
which corrects for the fact this is a *subset* of the entire
population. (End of Remark)

**Why This Matters: Central Limit Theorem.**
In practice, a rule of thumb we use when given the mean and standard
deviation for some data is to pretend it's a [Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), so
essentially "all" the data is contained within 3 standard deviations of
the mean, and 2/3ds of the data within 1 standard deviation (it's really
the [68-95-99.7 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule)). Why can we do this? It's the
[Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem),
which requires a course on probability theory just to understand.

Technically, this rule is not always justified. It's only when we have a
*huge* amount of data, we can just suppose it's normally distributed.

**Example.** Friday 20 June 2015, the Cincinnati Red Hots played the
Miami Marlins â€” from our data over the past 10 years, we see Cincinnati
has an average of 4.467 runs per game with a standard deviation of
0.376, whereas Miami has an average of 3.64 with a standard deviation of
0.344. The game's
[final score](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2015_06_19_miamlb_cinmlb_1&partnerId=LR_wrap#game=2015_06_19_miamlb_cinmlb_1,game_state=Wrapup,game_tab=wrap): Cincinnati 5, Miami 0.

What happened?! Well, this doesn't seem unreasonable for Cincinnati, but
for Miami...this is bizarre. If we use the data given, the probability
Miami would score 0 runs is 1.8175&times;10<sup>-26</sup>. You are more
likely to get struck by lightning *and*
[win the Lottery](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ronald-l-wasserstein/chances-of-winning-powerball-lottery_b_3288129.html)...then
getting struck by lightning again, and winning the lottery once more for
good measure.

The moral of this, well for us, is *a small dataset causes problems with
this heuristic applying normal distributions everywhere.*

# First Model

We want to consider the first model estimating the runs per game for a
given team. The variable we are solving for is the runs per game, a
crude estimate for this is just the number of runs for a team divided by
the number of games played. (It'd be a huge boon to get a better
approximation.)

The simplest model we can consider (ever) is...well, just hard-coding a
solution like "Home team always wins". It's as questionable here as for
[random numbers](https://xkcd.com/221/).

The next simplest model is to consider the runs scored in a game as a
[linear combination](http://stattrek.com/regression/linear-regression.aspx) of factors.
The three factors we consider are:
[On-Base Percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage)
(how frequently the hitter reaches base),
the batting average, and the
[Slugging Percentage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage)
(a measure of the hitter's power). This models the runs per game as:

```clojure
(defn predict-runs-per-game [on-base-percentage slugging-percentage]
  (+ constant
     (* b0 on-base-percentage)
     (* b1 slugging-percentage)))
```

We then find the `constant`, and coefficients `b0` and `b1` which
minimize the standard error.

**Problem: Collinearity.** One problem we have to consider is these
inputs are not independent of each other. They are correlated with each
other, sometimes strongly. The technical term for such a phenomena is
["collinearity"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity). This
is a problem we will have to address, or else use a different model.

For us, we expect `b0` is the increase in predicted runs if on-base
percentage increases while we hold slugging-percentage constant. But we
cannot hold slugging-percentage constant as on-base percentage
increases, because these two are correlated with each other. So an
increase in on-base percentage is usually accompanied by an increase in
slugging percentage. This is the problem in a nutshell. (End of remark
on collinearity)

**Intuition Behind Linear Regression.** The basic intuition is, just as
we had the standard deviation measure how far the data "spread out" on
average (by measuring the average distance to the mean-value), we can
consider the error from the linear regression the same way. For the
simple case where $y=a+bx$, where we have 1 input variable and 1 output
variable, we have our raw data <span>$(x\_{j}, y\_{j})$</span>. We consider the
distance from the predicted value <span>$\hat{y}\_j=a+bx\_j$</span> from the actual
value <span>$y_{j}$</span>,
<div>$$ RSS = \sum\_{j} (\hat{y}\_{j} - y\_{j})^{2}.$$</div>
Minimizing this error would give the optimal fit.

We can actually *test* how good a fit we have. How? Well, supposing that
this *residual error* <span>$\varepsilon\_{j}=\hat{y}\_{j}-y\_{j}$</span>
is a normally distributed random variable. What does this mean? Well, if
we plot the linear regression, we can "drop a Gaussian" at each
<span>$x_{j}$</span> and measure how many standard deviations out the
actual value is from the predicted value:

![Testing the Linear Regression Intuition]({{ site.url }}/assets/linear-regression-derivation.png)

We can use this to rigorously test how well our linear regression fits
the data. Sometimes we don't need testing, but this is only when it's so
terrible that we need a better model...which is precisely the case *we*
are in! (End of Discussion on Intuition)

**Dealing with Nonlinearity.** Suppose we wanted to try to consider some
nonlinear factor, like the exponential of the team's weight in
pounds...or something. We can transform the data *before* plugging it
into the regression, so we get this new signal, and our linear
regression becomes $y=a+bx+c\cdot\exp(w)$. This "preprocessing" allows
the linear regression to be quite robust and useful, *which is why its
our first plan of attack against any problem.*

## Predictions

I made a number of predictions for the games scheduled on 21 June 2015,
using **a simple linear regression** with the **on-base percentage** and
**slugging percentage** as the input to generate the average number of
runs per game. Lets see how this simple model performed...

## Reflections on Results

Well, perhaps unsurprisingly, the predictions were bad. Although we
predicted the Nationals would win against the Pirates, and Detroit would
dominate the Yankees, we were comically wrong about the score. And we
weren't even close with the other games! The important question to ask
is "Why?"

First, our data is far too coarse-grained. We tried making predictions
about the results of a *game* using *per-season* data. One step forward
would be to use data better suited to our problem. We will (next time)
use [Retrosheet's data](http://www.retrosheet.org/game.html), which has
play-by-play data for every game dating back to 1871.

Second, our model may be too simple. As noted earlier, there was the
collinearity problem we never dealt with. But trying to figure out what
combinations of data to use is rather taxing, especially when I don't
know a lot about the subject.
