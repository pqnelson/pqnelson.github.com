I've been accumulating some ideas which would be neat but consume too
much time.

# Lisp Machine on Raspberry Pi

Looking at the Symbolics I-machine, write suitable microcode for a
Raspberry Pi to turn it into a Lisp machine. After all, the original
Lisp Machines were microcoded atop a RISC processor.

Write a series of blog posts ("Lisp Machine in Small Pieces"?)
explaining the implementation of such a thing. 

# FORTRAN II Compiler

The original FORTRAN I Compiler has been lost to the sands of time. But
the FORTRAN II Compiler has been preserved, printed and bound in three
volumes stored at the Smithsonian. Unfortunately, it's all assembly code
for the IBM-704.

Fortunately, Donald Knuth's MIX computer is remarkably similar to the IBM-704.

Translate FORTRAN II into MIX assembly code. Present it as a series of 
"algorithms" and "programs" as Donald Knuth does it in _The Art of Computer Programming_
with commentary alongside the assembly code.

# Space Cadet Mechanical Keyboard

Figure out a way to create a mechanical keyboard replica of the famous
Space Cadet.

Or, failing that, a UNIX Keyboard (like the Sun keyboard).
