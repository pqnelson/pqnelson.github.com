# Glossary of Hegelian Terms

## Quality

Hegel's "die Qualität" translates to the Greek ποιότητες, which appears
in Aristotle's _Metaphysics_ Book  Z (VII), around 1028A20, on Substance:

> Now of all these senses which “being” has, the primary sense is
> clearly the “what” which denotes the substance (because when we
> describe the quality of a particular thing we say that it is “good” or
> “bad,” and not “five feet high” or “a man”; but when we describe what
> it is, we say not that it is “white” or “hot” or “five feet high,” but
> that it is “a man” or “a god”), and all other things are said to “be”
> because they are either quantities or qualities or affections or some
> other such thing.
>
> [τὰ δ᾿ ἄλλα λέγεται ὄντα τῷ τοῦ οὕτως ὄντος τὰ μὲν ποσότητες εἶναι, τὰ
> δὲ **ποιότητες,** τὰ δὲ πάθη, τὰ δὲ ἄλλο τι τοιοῦτον.]

(Emphasis mine) This is a bit of a conservation of misery, since
Aristotle's _Metaphysics_ Zeta is notoriously dense (see, e.g., Frank
A. Lewis's _How Aristotle gets by in Metaphysics Zeta_ for a commentary
on just that one book!).
