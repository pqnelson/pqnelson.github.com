I have mixed feelings about philosophy, hence why it's relegated to a
hidden category.

The basic motivation for studying Western philosophy appears to be to
practice critical thinking: analyze a passage in a natural language,
formalize it in propositional or first-order logic, evaluate it, etc.

Each step is highly nontrivial.
