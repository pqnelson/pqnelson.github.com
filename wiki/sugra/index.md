Supergravity attempts to use the tools of supersymmetry in some form of
gravity, usually general relativity.

# Derivations

**Derivation 1.** If we take an independent supersymmetric
transformation at each spacetime point, we arrive at a corresponding
*gauge symmetry*. The (global) supersymmetry generators have the
anti-commutation relations
$\\{Q^{i}\_{\alpha},\bar{Q}^{j}\_{\beta}\\}=2\delta^{ij}(\gamma^{n})\_{\alpha\beta}P\_{n}$
where $Q$ and $\bar{Q}$ are the spinorial charges (generators of the
SUSY algebra), $\gamma$ the Dirac gamma matrix, and $P$ is the
four-momentum operator. Observe when we turn this into local symmetries,
the four-momentum operator include local spacetime translations. Hence
the resulting gauge theory should include gravity. 

**Derivation 2.** Take some superstring theory. The limit as the string
length goes to zero results in a supersymmetric gauge theory which
includes gravity. It turns outs, these are the more exotic supergravity
theories. 

# Problems

When we consider the simplest model (i.e., $\mathcal{N}=1$) for
canonical quantum super-gravity, we find it
[has no bosonic solutions](has-no-bosonic-solutions.html). 
This means we cannot interpret "vanilla general relativity" as a "limit"
of canonical quantum supergravity.
