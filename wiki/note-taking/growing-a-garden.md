Another approach to taking notes, which helps with marshalling resources
for further reference or future study, is to grow a digital garden. I've
noticed Emacs's org-mode is quite good at organizing such notes.

This approach dates back to 1998, Mark Bernstein introduced the notion
of a ["hypertext garden"](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html).

I suppose this wiki could be viewed as a digital garden, since I'm
growing articles by my wandering interests. Though there's a notion of
"interconnectedness from article-to-article" which is lacking in my
organizational approach, which seems to be just a list of articles
organized as trees (some pages are just branches, other pages are
leafs).
