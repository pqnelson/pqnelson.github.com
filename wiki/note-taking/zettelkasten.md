# Workflow

**Step 0: Read the Book.** (Or article, or whatever.)

**Step 1: Take reading notes.** As you read, take notes in your own words.
I typically write this down on a quarter slip of printer paper (4.25
inch wide, 5.5 inch tall). Write only on one side of the paper, the
other side has the bibliographic information (author names, book/article
title, publisher, chapter or volume number, sections read, date
published, and then near the bottom the date I read it). I also use blue
highlighter to mark the side of the slip.

These reading notes will be stored in a shoe box. They form the basis
for all my permanent notes, my entries in the Zettelkasten.

**Step 2: Go for a walk.** Or cook a meal, or do somehing else, and let
the reading percolate for an hour or two (or more).

**Step 3: Write permanent notes.**
Using a quarter-slip of printer paper (5.5 inches across, 4.25 inches
tall --- approximately an A6-sized piece of paper using "landscape"
orientation), I usually write a terse summary or topic phrase on the
top-right corner. There is an ID written in a later step, written in the
top-left corner (more on that in a minute).

I write in a manner similar to "Twitter threads", i.e., a sequence of
atomic ideas. While writing slips, I can consult notes from step 1 or
previously written slips in my Zettelkasten. If I need to reference or
"link" to entries already existing in my Zettelkasten, I use red ink to
write in parentheses after making the connection explicit.

But it is very important that each slip has exactly one atomic idea, not
two, not three, not more than exactly one.

These will be stored in a separate shoe box, **not** the bibliography
shoe box. This separate shoe box (either metaphorical or literal) is
referred to as the Zettelkasten.

**Step 4: Continue or integrate.**
If I have finished a chapter in a book, section in a technical paper, or
maybe a section in a book, and I have assembled slips based on reading
the chapter, now I assign IDs to the slips. And if I have not finished
the section or chapter, I basically go back to step 0.

I also usually have some "guiding question" in mind which filters the
literature down. For example, right now, I am (a) trying to articulate
further the foundations of mathematics using set theory, and relatedly
(b) trying to explain to my Zettelkasten what "model theory" is in
general.

Adding notes to the Zettelkasten allows me to spark questions a
hypothetical intelligent colleague would ask, if this Zettelkasten were
the contents of my colleague's brain.

**Step 5: Store reading notes.**
I take a blue highlighter and across the "outward facing spine" draw a
blue line, then place the reading notes in a shoe box (or other storage
container exclusively for reading notes). The reading notes are
organized by author, year, title.

The IDs are more-or-less faithful to Luhmann's Zettelkasten. I have
top-level topics. For me, the first four top-level topics are based off
of what I am interested in at the moment, and they are:

1. Zettelkasten
2. System and Method
3. Computer Science
4. Mathematics

I then have sub-topics. These are organized as a thread "within" a
top-level topic. For "System and Method", the sub-topics I have are:

- 2/1 System
- 2/2 Method
- 2/3 Language

At times, I want to go further on a topic discussed on a card. I use
alphabetical letters appended to the ID to indicate a branch has
occurred. The ordering of branches is insignificant and could be
permuted. "System and Method" has sub-topics and branches:

- 2/1 System
- 2/1a Component [branch off of 2/1]
- 2/1b Environment [separate branch off 2/1]
- 2/1c Interaction [third branch off of 2/1]
- 2/2 Method
- 2/2a Scientific Methods
- 2/2b Method as Generalized Inference
- 2/2c Method as System
- 2/3 Language
- 2/3a Formal Language
- 2/3b Pattern Language
- 2/3c Language Game

Each branch itself is self-similar to a top-level topic, in the sense
that it starts a thread with numbers starting at 1 appended to the ID.
These, in turn, can have branches (which appends an alphabetical letter
to the ID number). For example,

- 2/2 Method
- 2/2a Scientific Methods
- 2/2a1 Empricism
- 2/2a1a Evidence [a branch elaborating something mentioned in 2/2a1]
- 2/2a1a1 Admissibility of Evidence [like top-level topics, this forms a thread]
- 2/2a1a2 Types of Evidence [another entry in the thread for branch 2/2a1a]
- 2/2a1a3 Absence of Evidence [continuing the thread for branch 2/2a1a]
- 2/2a1a4 Evidence of Absence
- 2/2a2 Popperianism [continuing the thread for branch 2/2a]
- 2/2a3 Paradigms [another thread in the 2/2a branch]
- 2/2a4 Research Programmes [and another]
- 2/2b Method as Generalized Inference
- 2/2b1 Rewriting rules
- 2/2c Method as System

The first topic, "Zettelkasten" is about the conventions I am trying to
adhere to when writing slips for my Zettelkasten: what color ink to use,
how to link two slips together, common patterns I've developed to
present information, etc.

The real strength is in linking slips from different fields together.
For example, "operational semantics" is a slip talking about how we can
give meaning to a programming language (basically, through an evaluation
relation presented as a bunch of inference rules). But it is how we give
meaning to one major foundations of mathematics, type theory. The other
major foundations of mathematics, logic, uses proof theory...which is
related to operational semantics. So I link the two together, noting for
operational semantics we have a proof system, then in red ink write
"(4/1c3)" [the ID number for proof theory]. Sometimes I write
"backlinks" (e.g., in this case, on the slip for proof theory, in the
lower left corner I would write in normal black ink the ID for
operational semantics, again in parentheses).

**Step 6: Use the Zettelkasten.**
If we adhere to the "Write one idea on a slip of paper, but no
more"-rule, then the Zettelkasten gives us fertile material to consult
when writing a paper. I take out the thread on a given topic, and look
at linked material, possibly taking them out as well, then I sit at my
desk, and write in pen on paper whatever comes to mind as I review the
topical material on these slips of paper.

I found, sadly by error, if I wrote too much on a slip, it leads to
worse writing. (I had too much content on my Zettel for "Formal
Grammar", and I believe my draft subsection on formal grammar suffered
because of this.)

# Choice of ID Numbering System

There are any number of ID numbering systems one could use. This
requires great consideration, and probably is the most subjective part
of the
