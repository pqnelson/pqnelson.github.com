There are some passages from Luhmann which I wanted to make noted.

## About Autopoiesis

Luhmann developed a "systems theoretic" approach to thinking about his
Zettelkasten. For him, a "system" was distinguished from its
"environment" by some kind of "boundary" (these quoted terms are all
Luhmann's terms). Without this boundary, there would be no "autonomy"
to a system and it would merge back into its environment.

This played a critical role in the notion of "autopoiesis" for
Luhmann, since it was characteristic of "living systems". And
Luhmann's Zettelkasten _was_ a "living system" of notes. Here's what
he had to say, specifically about communication (English translation
from _Journal of Sociocyberntics_ **6** (2008) pp 84-95):

> # Communications as the basic elements of social systems
> 
> To use _ipsissima verba_ ‘autopoietic systems’ are systems that are
> defined as unities, as networks of productions of components, that
> recursively, through their interactions, generate and realize the
> network that produces them and constitute, in the space in which they
> exist, the boundaries of the "network as components that participate
> in the realization of the network" (Maturana, 1981: 21). Autopoietic
> systems, then, are not only self-organizing systems. Not only do they
> produce and eventually change their own structures but their
> self-reference applies to the production of other components as
> well. This is the decisive conceptual innovation. It adds a
> turbocharger to the already powerful engine of self-referential
> machines. Even elements, that is last components (individuals), which
> are, at least for the system itself, undecomposable, are produced by
> the system itself. Thus, everything which is used as a unit by the
> system is produced as a unit by the system itself. This applies to
> elements, processes, boundaries and other structures, and last but not
> least to the unity of the system itself. Autopoietic systems, of
> course, exist within an environment. They cannot exist on their
> own. But there is no input and no output of unity.
> 
> Autopoietic systems, then, are sovereign with respect to the
> constitution of identities and differences. They do not create a
> material world of their own. They presuppose other levels of
> reality. Human life, for example, presupposes the small scope of
> temperature in which water exists as a liquid. But whatever they use
> as identities and as differences is of their own making. In other
> words, they cannot import identities and differences from the outer
> world; these are forms about which they have to decide themselves.
>
> Social systems use communication as their particular mode of
> autopoietic reproduction.  Their elements are communications which are
> recursively produced and reproduced by a network of communications and
> which cannot exist outside of such a network. Communications are not
> "living" units, they are not "conscious" units, they are not
> "actions". Their unity requires a synthesis of three selections:
> namely, information, utterance[1] and understanding (including
> misunderstanding).[2] This synthesis is produced by the network of
> communication, not by some kind of inherent power of consciousness, or
> by the inherent quality of the information.  Also --- and this goes
> against all kinds of "structuralism" --- communication is not produced
> by language. Structuralists have never been able to show how a
> structure can produce an event.  At this point, the theory of
> autopoiesis offers a decisive advance. It is the network of events
> which reproduces itself and structures are required for the
> reproduction of events by events.
>
> The synthesis of information, utterance and understanding cannot be
> preprogrammed by language. It has to be recreated from situation to
> situation by referring to previous communications and to possibilities
> of further communications which are to be restricted by the actual
> event. This operation requires self-reference. It can in no way use
> the environment. Information, utterances and understandings are
> aspects which for the system cannot exist independently of the system;
> they are co-created within the process of communication. Even
> "information" is not something which the system takes in from the
> environment. Pieces of information don't exist "out there", waiting to
> be picked up by the system. As selections they are produced by the
> system itself in comparison with someting else (e.g., in comparison
> with something which could have happened).
>
> The communicative synthesis of information, utterance and
> understanding is possible only as an elementary unit of an ongoing
> social system. As the operating unit it is undecomposable, doing its
> autopoietic work only as an element of the system. However, further
> units of the same system can distinguish between information and
> utterance and can use this distinction to separate
> hetero-referentiality and self-referentiality. They can, being
> themselves undecomposable for the moment, refer primarily to the
> content of previous communications, asking for further information
> about the information; or they can question the "how" and the "why" of
> the communication, focusing on its utterance. In the first case, they
> will pursue heteroreferentiality, in the second case
> self-referentiality. Using a terminology proposed by Gotthard Günther
> (1979), we can say that the process of communication is not simply
> auto-referential in the sense that it is what it is. It is forced by
> its own structure to separate and to recombine hetero-referentiality
> and self-referentiality. Referring to itself, the process has to
> distinguish information and utterance and to indicate which side of
> the distinction is supposed to serve as the base for further
> communication. Therefore, self-reference is nothing but reference to
> this distinction between hetero-reference and self-reference. And,
> whereas auto-referentiality could be seen as a one-value thing (it is
> what it is), and could be described by a logic with two values only,
> namely, true and false, the base of social systems is one of much
> greater complexity because its self-reference (1) is based on an
> ongoing auto-referential (autopoietic) process, which refers to itself
> (2) as processing the distinction between itself and (3) its
> topics. If such a system did not have an environment, it would have to
> invent it as the horizon of its hetero-referentiality.
>
> The elementary, undecomposable units of the system are communications
> of minimal size.  This minimal size, again, cannot be determined
> independent of the system.[3] It is constituted by further
> communication or by the prospect of further communication. An
> elementary unit has the minimal meaning which is necessary for
> reference by further communication --- for instance, the minimal
> meaning which still can be negated. Further communication can very
> well separate pieces of information, utterances and understandings and
> discuss them separately, but this still would presuppose their
> synthesis in previous communication. The system does not limit itself
> by using constraints for the constitution of its elementary units. If
> need be, it can communicate about everything and can decompose aspects
> of previous communication to satisfy actual desires. As an operating
> system, however, it will not always do this to the
> extreme. Communication includes understanding as a necessary part of
> the unity of its operation. It does not include the acceptance of its
> content. It is not the function of communication to produce a
> consensus as the favoured state of mind. Communication always results
> in an open situation of either acceptance or rejection. It reproduces
> situations with a specified and enforced choice. Such situations are
> not possible without communication; they do not occur as natural
> happenings. Only communication itself is able to reach a point which
> bifurcates further possibilities. The bifurcation itself is a
> reduction of complexity and, by this very fact, an enforcement of
> selection. Automatically, the selection of further communication is
> either an acceptance or rejection of previous communication or a
> visible avoidance or adjournment of the issue. Whatever its content
> and whatever its intention, communication reacts within the framework
> of enforced choice. To take one course is not to take the other. This
> highly artificial condition structures the self-reference of the
> system; it makes it unavoidable to take other communications of the
> same system into account, and every communication renews the same
> condition within a varied context. If the system were set up to
> produce consensus it soon would come to an end. It would never produce
> and reproduce a society. In fact, however, it is designed to reproduce
> itself by submitting itself to self-reproduced selectivity. Only this
> arrangement makes social evolution possible, if evolution is seen as a
> kind of structural selection superinduced on selectivity.

See also Hugh Baxter's "Niklas Luhmann’s Theory of Autopoietic Legal Systems"
([`doi:10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-134027`](https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102612-134027))
for a very readable review of Luhmann's notions of systems and
autopoiesis.

Curiously, it is intriguing to also compare this to  Michel Bitbol and
Pier Luigi Luisi's "Autopoiesis with or without cognition: defining
life at its edge" _Journal of the Royal Society Interface_ **1** no.1
(2004) 99-107,
[`doi:10.1098/rsif.2004.0012`](https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2004.0012),
especially section 6 (but also sections 5, 7 are worth reading as well).

Also worth quoting is Luhman's _Organization and Decision_, chapter 2,
where he observes:

> The most important of the concretizing, circle-breaking assumptions can be
> briefly summarized as follows:
>
> 1. The basal unity of an autopoietic system takes the temporal form of
>    an event, thus an occurrence that draws a distinction between “before”
>    and “after”; which can therefore be observed only on the basis of the
>    distinction between before and after. When we are concerned with
>    results, we will also talk of “operation” and, in the case of
>    organizations, of “decision.” In comparing theories, it is important
>    to bear this grounding in events (and not in substances) in mind. It
>    follows that the theory presumes discontinuity – continuous
>    disintegration – and considers continuity (thingness, substance,
>    process) to need explaining. A theory of autopoietic systems construed
>    in this manner is in radical opposition to all sorts of process
>    theories, including dialectical theories. It rejects any sort of
>    essentialism and, on the contrary, demands that every event (or in our
>    field every decision) leave the following one to a subsequent
>    event. Forms of essence are only directives for the repetition of
>    selection. Autopoiesis theory is also to be seen in opposition to
>    action theory. For action theories rely on the ideas (such as
>    intentions, or purposes) of actors for linking up their “unit acts,”
>    whereas events such as communications that form autopoietic systems
>    produce a surplus of possibilities, so that something suitable can be
>    chosen in the next step. What is then selected need not be
>    anticipated; the decision is better and more typically made with a
>    preceding event in mind.
> 2. A system that generates itself has to observe itself; that is to
>    say, it has to be able to distinguish itself from its
>    environment. This is sometimes denied, but since “organization”
>    cannot be taken to mean the entire world, some criterion or other
>    has to be given for defining what is indicated as an
>    organization. The theoretically decisive question is then whether
>    this demarcation is carried out by the organization itself or, if
>    this is not the case, by whom.
> 3. In observing itself, the organization does not observe itself as
>    a fixed object whose properties are recognizable but uses its own
>    identity only to present and abandon ever new
>    determinations. Autopoietic systems can therefore also vary their
>    structures (one speaks of “self-organization”), provided that
>    this is compatible with the continuation of autopoiesis. All
>    reflection on identity that enduring self-descriptions with
>    substantive characteristics propose therefore has to proceed
>    highly selectively, opting for normative assumptions in the
>    process and mostly remaining controversial.
> 4. The variability of the self taken in each case as point of
>    reference is guaranteed by the circumstance that the organization
>    observes itself in observation. Even the organizational system
>    itself operates on the level of second-order observation; it
>    constantly diagnoses its own observations (albeit not in every
>    single case). The _theory_ of organization must therefore set in
>    at the level of _third_-order observation. It observes a system
>    that is observing itself and can consequently extend its
>    observation to the matters that are inaccessible to
>    self-observation. This brings us to the classical sociological
>    problem of latent structures and functions.
> 5. Autopoiesis is accordingly possible only if the system is in a
>    constant state of uncertainty about itself in relation to the
>    environment _and can produce and monitor this uncertainty through
>    self-organization_.  The system cannot convert the built-in (we
>    shall also say self-generated) uncertainty into certainty. The
>    absorption of uncertainty (which we will be dealing with in
>    detail) can only be a transformation of the given, current form
>    of uncertainty in adjustment to changing states of irritation.
>    Reflection or self-description can do nothing to change this
>    state of affairs. Every “transcendental” identity could endanger
>    the further reproduction of the system by itself.
> 6. The best possibility for coping with uncertainty is to stick by
>    what has already happened. Organizations therefore clarify the
>    meaning of their action largely in retrospect. This in turn
>    tempts them to pay little attention to the given state of the
>    environment. This outdifferentiation at the operational level
>    must, however, be balanced out at the structural level.  The
>    appropriateness of structures (e.g., decision-making programs or
>    the typical time needed for operations is mostly decided with an
>    eye to the environment.
> 7. Concepts such as self-reference, self-observation, or
>    self-description presuppose operations that realize what is
>    meant. These operations have to be carried out in the system
>    (where else?). If, at the same time, one takes into account that
>    this is not possible in the form of unconnected, singular events,
>    one comes up against the problem of the recursive interconnection
>    of these operations. To make itself possible, every operation has
>    to presuppose recursion to and anticipation of other operations
>    of the same system. This is the only way in which contexts can be
>    identified and boundaries produced and reproduced in relation to
>    the environment.  Regardless of the fact that this state of
>    affairs was first mentioned by a biologist, Humberto Maturana, we
>    therefore also speak of autopoietic systems in our context. 29
>    When the term was first applied to organizations, it was
>    therefore explicitly marked out as a metaphor. Too broad a
>    concept of cognition and too narrow ties to biochemistry have
>    strongly influenced further discussion and often led it astray.
> 8. In view of a complex, often confused debate on the subject, a
>    number of explanatory remarks are called for.
>    1. As the term “poíesis” indicates, it is a question of producing
>       a work, of generating the system as its own product. This
>       naturally does not mean that the system itself has all the
>       causes necessary for self-production at its disposal. No
>       causal theory could accept such a concentration of all causes
>       in one system (unless it be God). This is already true of
>       concepts like product, production, and reproduction at the
>       conceptual level. Indeed, only when a system not simply exists
>       but has to reproduce itself out of its own products can it, in
>       precisely this regard, be independent of the environment. But
>       it is important for the system to have causes at its disposal
>       (in an organization, for example, members bound by
>       instructions), so that under normal circumstances it can
>       ensure its own reproduction.
>   2. The concept stresses not the regular – let alone unconditional
>      – certainty of production but _reproduction_, that is to say,
>      production from own products. With Heinz von Foerster we can
>      also speak of a “historical machine,” in other words, a system
>      that produces further operations from the state in which it has
>      put itself.
>   3. Autopoiesis is accordingly formally defined. As concept, it
>      therefore leaves completely open what material operations it
>      performs. They can be biochemical or neurophysiological
>      operations, but also conscious disposal over attention or
>      communications. Neither analogy nor metaphor enters the
>      argument. What is involved are various applications of a
>      general theory.
>   4. The simple concept of autopoiesis serves to distinguish and
>      indicate a state of affairs. It has no empirical explanatory
>      value as concept.  What it does, above all, is to oblige other
>      concepts to adapt – for example, the concept of evolution or
>      the understanding of the relationship between system and
>      environment. Everything else depends on what operations
>      materialize autopoiesis, and through what structures produced
>      by evolution and learning.
>   5. The autopoiesis of the system is realized at the level of
>      _operations_.  It is therefore compatible with all structures
>      that permit operation to connect with operation. In this
>      context the concept of structure correlates with autopoiesis,
>      and not as it usually does with the division of work. Through
>      operations, structures are generated and reproduced and
>      possibly varied or simply forgotten for use in operations. We
>      can therefore not infer structural conservatism from the
>      concept of autopoiesis. On the contrary, it is the very closure
>      of the system against the environment that gives it
>      opportunities for structural variation that direct ties would
>      not afford.  Autopoietic modes of operation are typically
>      one-off inventions of evolution, which in the course of history
>      tend toward structural diversification. “Autopoiesis” thus
>      refers only to a limit to possible structural variation. But as
>      evolution over long periods and domains teaches us, it is
>      precisely the difference between inside and outside that
>      accelerates change. However, it naturally also teaches us that
>      change does not obey the wishes of particular observers, so
>      that to the observer the systems involved may appear rigid and
>      immobile.
>   6. The recursive interconnection of operations follows neither
>      logical nor rational rules. It merely produces connections and
>      the prospect of connectivity. Sales figures, for example, can
>      be treated as proof of the success and quality of the given
>      organizational structures. Information can thus arouse
>      suspicion of interest-specific distortions and encourage
>      further efforts to confirm this suspicion. In international
>      relations between organizations, for instance, ecological
>      criteria for products may be interpreted as trade
>      barriers. Recursions, therefore, ensure the maintenance and
>      reproduction of suppressed paradoxes. Anything particular is
>      always something else at the same time.
> 9. Autopoietic systems are operationally closed, and for this very
>    reason they are autonomous systems. The concept of operational
>    closure allows for no gradualization; in other words, it does not
>    allow the system to operate in its environment or the environment
>    to operate in the system.  A system cannot be more or less
>    autopoietic, but it can be more or less complex. If only for
>    mathematically demonstrable reasons, operationally closed
>    autopoietic systems cannot be described in terms of input/output
>    functions. This gives rise to impressions and descriptions like
>    freedom, arbitrariness, and intransparency, which we shall be
>    going into in detail. The concept of operational closure, too,
>    abstracts from causal assumptions, and thus by no means claims
>    (even relative) causal isolation.  A system can be operationally
>    closed and, like the brain, rely strongly on the constant input
>    of resources of a very specific sort (in this case blood
>    circulation). Operational closure means only that the system can
>    operate only in the context of its own operations and in so doing
>    has to rely on structures generated by these very operations. In
>    this sense we can speak of self-organization or, as far as
>    operations are concerned, of structural determinedness.
> 10. These theoretical propositions have far-reaching consequences
>     for the relationship between system and environment. In this
>     case, operational closure does not mean that an organizational
>     system can have no contact with the intra-societal
>     environment. Society makes intra-societal communication possible
>     across subsystem boundaries. On the other hand, an organization
>     cannot participate in communication without observing itself as
>     participant. As recipients of communications, the organization’s
>     own structures control what information the system is irritated
>     by and stimulated to process information itself. As sender of
>     communications, the organization makes decisions about what it
>     wishes to communicate and what not. To this extent, the
>     environment remains for the organization a construction of its
>     own whose reality is naturally not questioned. In this, we agree
>     with Karl Weick. What is observed as environment in the
>     organizational system is always a construct of its own, filling
>     in the otherreference of the system. As it were, the environment
>     validates the decisions of the system by providing the context
>     that allows the system to determine in retrospect what has been
>     decided (Weick speaks of enactment). It allows uncomfortable
>     causes for the system’s own decisions to be externalized, thus
>     “punctuating” its own operations. It is a backup area for
>     problems, which allows the system to ignore the part it plays in
>     generating problems. In sum, it allows the system to relate its
>     own operations to a niche without asking why the world and
>     society in particular contain such niches. This is what the old
>     concept of “milieu” means.
> 11. Although biology has given us the concept of autopoiesis, we can
>     very well leave it open whether and how the reproduction of
>     relatively stable large chemical molecules in cells can be
>     understood as autopoietic: perhaps because it is possible only
>     in cells, perhaps because they are highly unstable entities that
>     have to be constantly replaced. In the case of social systems,
>     autopoiesis is much easier to recognize, or at least quite
>     differently structured, for social systems are not entities
>     requiring replication that constantly have to be replaced. Like
>     consciousness systems, they consist only of events, which pass
>     in arising and which have to be succeeded not by the same events
>     but by _others_. The ongoing transition from one element to
>     another – the ongoing reproduction of otherness – can be
>     understood only as autopoiesis, for it presupposes connectivity
>     generated within the system itself. No environment could input
>     anything suitable at the speed required. Only the system itself
>     can stop its own decay, which takes place from moment to
>     moment. And this makes very specific demands on structures; they
>     must not strive for repetition but first of all regulate the
>     transition from one to the other. As we have seen, this requires
>     orientation on highly referential but also determinable
>     _meaning_.
> 12. Autopoiesis relies on a system being able to generate internal
>     improbabilities deviating from what is usual. Structurally
>     limited contingencies then take effect in the system as

>     (not in biological systems such as cells, immune systems,
>     brains, but only in systems that can distinguish between
>     themselves and the environment in the medium of meaning). An
>     autopoietic system can thus inform only itself, and in the
>     system information has the function of selectively limiting the
>     options for continuing the system’s own operations, with the
>     further function that decisions can be made relatively rapidly
>     through connectivity options.
> 13. Closure in this operational sense is a condition for the
>     openness of systems. Older systems theory had, with respect to
>     the law of entropy in thermodynamics, spoken of open systems to
>     explain how order is developed and maintained against the
>     trend. But it failed to ask what enables a system to be open; in
>     other words, what systemic order has to exist for a system to be
>     able to afford openness and possibly even increase the
>     complexity of the aspects in which it can be open. This question
>     was not put because empirical examples and/or the input/output
>     model had been the orienting factors. Although even older

>     to information and open with regard to energy, only the more
>     recent theory of self-referential systems clearly states that
>     operational closure is the condition for openness.
> 14. The theory of autopoietic systems distinguishes strictly between
>     the continuation of autopoiesis and the maintenance of certain
>     structures that serve to ensure sufficient redundancy and
>     connectivity, and thus make autopoiesis possible in the first
>     place – in one way or another.  Structures are thus assumed to
>     be functional, contingent, and differently possible. From the
>     disposition of the theory, this permits understanding for the
>     ambiguity of structural arrangements, the need to interpret
>     them, and their circumventability. We could also say that the

>     observer particularly to the circumstance that structures have
>     meaning, and thus have to be constituted in open horizons of
>     reference to other possibilities, whereas autopoiesis itself is
>     not a topic in autopoietic systems. This brings us very close to

>     hermeneutic “interpretation” of reality, without, however,
>     having to take recourse to behaviorist (Mead) or subjectivist
>     assumptions. In what follows, we will repeatedly see that
>     uncertainties have to be reduced and ambiguities clarified in
>     the decision-making process; but also that uncertainty and
>     ambiguity in the processing of meaning are always regenerated,
>     and that the autopoiesis of organizations, in particular, is
>     kept in motion precisely by uncertainty being both reduced and
>     renewed. The impressive gain this complex conceptual maneuver
>     affords is to shift the basic problem in systems theory from
>     _maintaining resources_ to that of _maintaining a
>     difference_. This also means that one no longer speaks of
>     “existential” necessities (an organization can exist only if...)
>     but of conditions of possibility for observing organizations. If
>     they cannot be distinguished, they cannot be observed. If we
>     describe organizations as autopoietic systems, we are therefore
>     always concerned with the generation and reproduction of a
>     difference (systems-theoretically: between system and
>     environment), and the concept of autopoiesis means that an
>     observer who uses it presupposes that this difference is
>     generated by _the system itself_ and reproduced by systemic
>     operations.



### What this means

Communication as an autopoiesitic system means _communication is in
response to earlier communications_.
