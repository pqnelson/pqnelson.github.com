This repository is just a working collection of my own notes,
small programs, etc. I doubt anyone will find it useful, but I
may need to refer to this later on... 

The wiki contains random notes, most of which are just duplicates
from somewhere else (written in my own words). But, hey, that's
true for *all* written documents!

It's one part [EWD](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/) and another
part Euler, with ten (or more) parts slow-wittedness.
