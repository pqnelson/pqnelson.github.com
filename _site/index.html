    <h1>Elements of Programming</h1>

    <p>Or, Alex Nelson&#39;s working notes for programming.</p>

<p>You probably have come here by accident, as there&#39;s really not much I
have published worth reading. </p>

<p>Paraphrasing Wittgenstein, a good guide will take you through the more
important streets more often than he takes you down side streets; a bad
guide will do the opposite. In programming pedagogy, I&#39;m a rather bad guide.
Instead of trying to write some self-contained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbaki">Bourbaki-esque</a>
programming site, I&#39;ll just cover problems I&#39;m currently facing in...whatever it
is I do.</p>
