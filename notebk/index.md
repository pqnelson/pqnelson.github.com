These are my notes on math and physics. The most popular note appears to
be the one on Feynman diagrams, apparently no one bothers explaining the
algoritm underpinning the calculations...

## Math

- [Notes on An Algebraic Formulation of Tangent Spaces]({{ site.url }}/assets/notebk/germs.pdf), 9 pages, 
  specifically using germs.
- [Introduction to Category Theory]({{ site.url }}/assets/notebk/introToCategoryTheory.pdf), 34 pages, 
  a never-completed set of notes introducing category theory from the
  perspective of "Stuff, Structure, and Properties" ("neo-Structuralism"?).

### From Lectures

- [Notes on Lie Groups and Algebra]({{ site.url }}/assets/notebk/lieGroupsAndAlgebras.pdf), 91 pages, 
  I took these notes from Albert Schwarz's lectures, any typos or errors
  are mines.
- [Homotopy Theory]({{ site.url }}/assets/notebk/homotopyTheory.pdf),
  67 pages, notes taken during Albert Schwarz's lectures on algebraic
  topology; errors are mine.


## Physics

- [Notes on Feynman Diagrams]({{ site.url }}/assets/notebk/feynman.pdf),
  32 pages, presents computing amplitudes from Feynman diagrams
  algorithmically. 
- [Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Conformal Weyl Gravity]({{ site.url }}/assets/notebk/conformal.pdf),
  9 pages, 
  term paper for Steve Carlip's course on general relativity
- [Relativistic Quantum Mechanics]({{ site.url }}/assets/notebk/rqm.pdf),
  11 pages, how to mix special relativity and quantum mechanics, using
  representation theory.
- [Hamiltonian Field Theory]({{ site.url }}/assets/notebk/hamiltonianFieldTheory.pdf),
  5 pages, a brief note on the canonical formalism for fields. _Purely
  Classical considerations only!_
- [Functional Methods in QFT]({{ site.url }}/assets/notebk/functionalQFT.pdf),
  25 pages, discusses "functional" approach to path integrals, and
  briefly how to determine Feynman rules.
