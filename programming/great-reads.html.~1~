<h2>Hello World?</h2>
<p>
You've found my pseudo-blog! (Although probably by mistake...)
</p>
<p>
I write about stuff I find interesting or useful in programming,
computer science, and related mathematics.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As my very last remark I should like to stress that the tool as a
whole should have still another quality. It is a much more subtle
one; whether we appreciate it or not depends much more on our
personal taste and education and I shall not even try to define
it. The tool should be charming, it should be elegant, it should
be worthy of our love. This is no joke, I am terribly serious
about this. In this respect the programmer does not differ from
any other craftsman: unless he loves his tools it is highly
improbable that he will ever create something of superior
quality. 
</p><p>
At the same time these considerations tell us the greatest
virtues a program can show: Elegance and Beauty.
