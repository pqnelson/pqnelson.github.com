<h2>Writing History?</h2>
<p>
I want to discuss some aspects of html5 for writing a history
text. I will discuss aspects like user comments, footnotes, and
"chunking" (an ambiguous term that I hope to clarify). 
</p>
<p>
I <em>will not</em> discuss: how to do research, how to structure
sentences, what grammar to use, what citation system should be
used, what models or historiographical paradigm should be
employed, etc. etc. etc.
</p>
<p>
In principle, the same "tools" presented here could be applied to
any field. I just chose history, since I'm reading
Gibbon's <em>Decline and Fall</em>.
</p>
<h3>Chunking</h3>
<p>
When writing for the web, people don't like to sit down and study
long paragraphs. (However, when reading on paper,
they <em>love</em> reading paragraphs!)
</p>
<p>
A different organization scheme is needed. In the 18th and 19th
centuries, it seems that historians implicitly used an outline.
</p>
<p>
"Chunking" is a term I use to describe mathematical writing which
numbers each point made (see, e.g., Arthur Besse's writings). Why
not use this with an outline structure?
</p>
<p>
The lay reader in a hurry can read each item in the outline, and
get the general idea of what is happening. The scholar can read
the body of the chunk and learn about the evidence.
</p>
<p>
What is an example? Consider the following snippet:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>1.0. Overview.</b> "Afghanistan, particularly rural
Afghanistan, provides an excellent example of a place where
tribal and ethnic groups take primacy over the individual. As a
result, any student of Afghan politics must become intimately
familiar with such groups and their relationships with one
another." 
</p>
<p>
<b>The Social Context of Tribes and Ethnic Groups.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>1.1.</b> People's primary loyalty is to their own kin,
village, tribe, or ethnic group, generally indicated by the
Arabic protean term <em>qawm</em>. [...]
</p>
<p>
<b>1.2. What is meant by ethnic identity?</b> "Following the work
of Fredrik Barth, they are most commonly defined as social groups
that meet four criteria: they are biologically replicating, share
fundamental cultural values, constitute a field of communication
and interaction, and are defined through self-definition and
definition by others." 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The html5 tags <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> works well with the details and
the "chunk header" (the bold text in my example).
</p>
<p>
I would urge the author to use the summary when writing prose,
and stick the evidence supporting it (citations, etc.) into
the rest of the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>
One caveat is that -- as of now -- only Chrome
supports <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>. However, there is
a <a href="https://github.com/manuelbieh/details-Polyfill">jQuery
    workaround <tt>[github.com]</tt></a>.
</p>
<h2>User Comments</h2>
<p>
I got this idea while
reading <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/">Real
    World Haskell</a>, that annotations and user comments should
be made on each paragraph.
</p>
<p>
This requires some technological know-how on the author's
part. There are some libraries I can refer to
(e.g., <a href="http://gitorious.org/stet">stet <tt>[gitorious.org]</tt></a>). 
But the reader wishing to use this should understand how to use a
database (e.g., MySQL).
</p>
<p>
Now, how to do this? It's a bit tricky, since we need to keep
track of paragraphs (and we don't want to lose comments or
misplace them). 
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.btbytes.com/bookmaker">Using <tt>[btbytes.com]</tt></a>
the Mercurial book's system is easy, but requires quite a few
packages (on Ubuntu): 
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install docbook
$ sudo apt-get install graphviz
$ sudo apt-get install inkscape
$ sudo apt-get install docbook-xsl docbook-xml docbook-dsssl
$ sudo apt-get install sqlite3
$ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
$ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv python-dev
</pre>
<p>
<a href="http://wookicentral.com/">Wooki</a> may be a lazier solution.

"History, which undertakes to record the transactions of the
past, for the instruction of future ages, would ill deserve that
honourable office if she condescended to plead the cause of
tyrants, or to justify the maxims of persecution." &mdash; Edward
